More and more apps go towards subscription model. I don’t blame the authors. I would probably do the same to maximise the income. Switching from a `product` to a `service`. Still, i am more and more _surprised_ to see the model being applied where i would never consider it. Ulysses is one of those apps. I think it all started with **Adobe** when they introduced it with Creative Cloud. But a text editor... doesn’t sound like a service. I buy a tool amd i use it whenever i need it. It’s not like i need some resources to use it. It doesn’t need some cloud space, it doesn’t need some constant support from the developers. I think I will not continue with Ulysses. Maybe i will keep using it as the old version and try to switch to **Editorial**.
